#### Think back to the first real "thing" you made, and keep that in mind when browsing this project. :)
#### I may clean up the code at some point, but it was mostly a "learning" project.

**wools++** provides Overcast Network (OC) players with additional gameplay statistics including objectives/deaths,
rolling values and time series plots.

wools++ is a community-driven and fan-made project. The part that does stuff is written in python, and
it uses jinja2 with bootstrap html/css/javascript templates for displaying. wools++ uses BeautifulSoup
to collect data from users' profiles at Project Ares and matplotlib and Google Charts to produce the graphs. The project
is hosted on Google's App Engine.
