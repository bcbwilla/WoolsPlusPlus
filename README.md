**wools++** provides Overcast Network (OC) players with additional gameplay statistics including objectives/deaths, 
rolling values and time series plots.

wools++ is a community-driven and fan-made project. The part that does stuff is written in python, and 
it uses jinja2 with bootstrap html/css/javascript templates for displaying. wools++ uses BeautifulSoup 
to collect data from users' profiles at Project Ares and matplotlib to produce the graphs. The project 
is hosted on Google's App Engine.
